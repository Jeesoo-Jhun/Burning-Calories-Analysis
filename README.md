# Burning Calories Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing calorie expenditure during physical activities. By leveraging a dataset that includes various physiological and activity-related parameters, the project aims to uncover insights into how different variables affect the number of calories burned. The analysis is conducted using Python, with a focus on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

Understanding the determinants of calorie expenditure is crucial for developing effective fitness and dietary plans. This project explores the relationships between various factors—such as age, gender, heart rate, and duration of activity—and the calories burned during exercise. The goal is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate calorie expenditure based on these variables.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following features:

- **Gender:** Male or Female
- **Age:** Age of the individual
- **Height:** Height in centimeters
- **Weight:** Weight in kilograms
- **Duration:** Duration of the activity in minutes
- **Heart Rate:** Average heart rate during the activity
- **Body Temperature:** Body temperature measured in degrees Celsius
- **Calories:** Calories burned during the activity (target variable)

## Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Statistical summary of the data
   - Visualization of feature distributions
   - Correlation analysis between features and target variable

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Training regression models to predict calories burned
   - Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics
